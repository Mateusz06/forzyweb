<h1>My Website (Work in Progress)</h1>

<p>Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This project is currently under development, and I'm excited to share my progress with you. Below, you'll find an overview of the project.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>I have made this website for fun for now, it is my first time hosting a website. I plan on making something serious out of it in the future. It's built using HTML and CSS. I am planning on using other programming languages like JS too later on.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Go to forzy.nl, there you will start on the home page.</p>
<p>( More steps in progress together with the website )</p>
